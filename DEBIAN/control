Description: Model-based Analysis for ChIP-Seq
 With the improvement of sequencing techniques, chromatin
 immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq)
 is getting popular to study genome-wide protein-DNA interactions. To
 address the lack of powerful ChIP-Seq analysis method, we present a
 novel algorithm, named Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS), for
 identifying transcript factor binding sites. MACS captures the
 influence of genome complexity to evaluate the significance of
 enriched ChIP regions, and MACS improves the spatial resolution of
 binding sites through combining the information of both sequencing tag
 position and orientation. MACS can be easily used for ChIP-Seq data
 alone, or with control sample with the increase of specificity.
 .
 Main Features:
 .
   * Predict ChIP fragment size from + and - strand peaks from raw data
   * Calculate local bias around ChIP peaks using a Poisson model.
   * Allow multiple reads at the exact same position.
   * Generate combined score track using Poisson CDF upper tail p/q-values, fold-enrichment and more.
   * Support narrow and broad factor calling.
   * Support Paired-End libraries.
   * Support comparison between two conditions.
